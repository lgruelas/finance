# Personal Finance Administrator

![Python master race](assets/python.png?raw=true "python")

## Getting started

This project has been made only for study porpouses, it allows you to administrate budgets for each category of your expenses, manage your accounts and so on, later on I might upload a demo video, for now it is under construction.

It uses docker for local usage and local development, there is a storic version that uses a local environment that you can find on older commits prior version 0.1.0.

### Prerequisites

You just need to have **docker** and been logged.

### Installation

For all the configurations you should keep an eye in 3 files:
-   `db/.env.example` - please rename it to `.env`
-   `frontend/.env.docker.example` - please rename it to `.env`
-   `backend/backend/settings/example.py` - please rename it to `dev.py` and fill as required.
-   Create an empty file at root called `.env.codecov`, this is needed in the CI env.

All this should be done with
```bash
chmod +x devenv.sh
./devenv.sh init
```

You also can use the commands `./devnev.sh check` and `./devenv.sh down` to check the status or erase the `.env` files.

Then you just need to build the images and containers, this is done just once with:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Run the App

In order to run the app in each subsecuent execution just use:

```bash
docker-compose start
```

### Stop the app

```bash
docker-compose stop
```

### Remove the containers

```bash
docker-compose down
```

**Note:** due to the volumes, the database info is persistent, to remove it permanently use:

```bash
dacker-compose down -v
```

And then erase the images and containers with `docker images rm <image-id>`.

## Relevant urls

The main URL is:

-   `http://localhost:8080`

The URL to communicate with the API is, by default:

-   `http://localhost:9090/api/v2/`
